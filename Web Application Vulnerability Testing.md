### Web Application Vulnerability Testing: Detailed Notes and Step-by-Step Guide

#### **Introduction**
Testing a web application for vulnerabilities is a structured process designed to identify security flaws. This is typically done through a combination of manual and automated techniques. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide to performing a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) on a web application.

---

### **1. Preparation and Reconnaissance**
#### **Step 1.1: Define the Scope**
- Identify the target web application, subdomains, and assets.
- Obtain proper permissions from the owner of the web application to perform testing (if not owned by you).
- Define the testing boundaries, e.g., APIs, databases, backend servers.

#### **Step 1.2: Information Gathering**
- Use **passive reconnaissance** (no interaction with the target):
  - Tools: Whois, DNS recon, Google Dorking.
- Use **active reconnaissance** (interact with the target):
  - Tools: Nmap (port scanning), Shodan (IoT or server information).
  - Techniques: Extract HTTP headers, check for exposed API keys.

#### **Step 1.3: Technology Stack Fingerprinting**
- Identify server software, frameworks, and CMS.
  - Tools: Wappalyzer, BuiltWith, WhatWeb.

### **2. Vulnerability Identification**
#### **Step 2.1: Automated Vulnerability Scanning**
- Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, etc.:
  - Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nessus, Nikto.
- Review scan reports for potential vulnerabilities.

#### **Step 2.2: Manual Testing**
- Look for hidden endpoints, sensitive data leaks in URLs, and insecure configurations.
- Use browser developer tools for debugging and testing.

#### **Step 2.3: Static and Dynamic Code Analysis**
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyze source code (if available) for security flaws.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Test the application in its running state.

### **3. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities**
#### **Step 3.1: Testing for OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities**
Follow the **OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities** as a framework:

1. **Injection Attacks**
   - Test for SQL Injection, Command Injection.
   - Tools: SQLmap, Burp Suite Intruder.
   - Example: Enter `' OR '1'='1` in input fields and observe the response.

2. **Broken Authentication**
   - Check for weak login mechanisms.
   - Test brute force attacks on login pages.
   - Tools: Hydra, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - Check if sensitive information is sent over plain HTTP.
   - Analyze cookies and headers for secure flags.
   - Tools: Wireshark, OWASP ZAP.

4. **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks**
   - Test XML parsers for vulnerabilities.
   - Example: Inject malicious XML payloads to access restricted files.

5. **Broken Access Control**
   - Check unauthorized access to admin panels, APIs, etc.
   - Tools: Manual testing, Burp Suite.

6. **Security Misconfigurations**
   - Look for default configurations, exposed directories.
   - Tools: Nikto, Nessus.

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Test input fields with payloads like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
   - Tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.

8. **Insecure Deserialization**
   - Test serialization mechanisms for arbitrary code execution.

9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
   - Check software versions and compare with CVE databases.
   - Tools: Dependency-Check, Retire.js.

10. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**
   - Simulate an attack and check logs to assess visibility.

#### **Step 3.2: Test Business Logic Flaws**
- Identify how the application handles workflows (e.g., bypassing payment mechanisms).
- Perform fuzz testing to input unexpected data.

---

### **4. Advanced Attack Techniques**
#### **Step 4.1: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
- Test endpoints that allow making HTTP requests on behalf of the server.
- Tools: Burp Collaborator.

#### **Step 4.2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- Test if actions can be performed on behalf of authenticated users without their consent.

#### **Step 4.3: API Security Testing**
- Inspect API endpoints for:
  - Rate limiting issues.
  - Improper authentication.
- Tools: Postman, Burp Suite.

#### **Step 4.4: Subdomain Takeover**
- Identify unclaimed subdomains pointing to external services.
- Tools: Sublist3r, Amass.

#### **Step 4.5: Cloud Security Testing**
- Check for misconfigured AWS S3 buckets or exposed credentials.

---

### **5. Post-Exploitation and Reporting**
#### **Step 5.1: Risk Assessment**
- Rate vulnerabilities based on their severity using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).

#### **Step 5.2: Documentation**
- Include the following in the report:
  - Executive summary.
  - Vulnerability details and reproduction steps.
  - Mitigation recommendations.

#### **Step 5.3: Clean-Up**
- Remove any payloads or test data injected during the process.
- Ensure no disruptions to the application after testing.

### **Preferred Order of Attacks**
1. Reconnaissance (Passive and Active)
2. Automated Scanning
3. Manual Testing of OWASP Top 10
4. API and Business Logic Flaws
5. Advanced Attacks (e.g., SSRF, Subdomain Takeover)
6. Post-Exploitation (e.g., logging, reporting)
